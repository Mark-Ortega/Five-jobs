# Peer Review: Codes runs and functions well, page linking and routing also work great, main issues are that the pages are mostly empty with text and images in them, no backgrounds, missing some of the required fields such as description, requirement, required stack, and other text from the assignment page, also responsive has a few issues such as little to no spacing between jobs in the home page menu.
